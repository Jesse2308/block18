// Unit Tests:
    // A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

        // Expect function to multiply two numbers then return the product of those number
        // Expect multiplication(3, 17) to be a number 
        // Expect multiplication(3, 17) to be 51
        // Expect multiplication (-3,17) to be -51
        // Expect multiplication("J", 3) to be an error





// A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
    
    
        // ConcatOdds ([-3,-4,-7,21], [29,31,-40,-21,27,38])
        // Expect array to display([-3,7,21,-21,29,31,27]) 
        // Expect array to display ([7,21,29,31,27])
        // ConcatOdds  ([4,6,8],[28,32,40,20,28,48]) / ([x,y,6], [8,t,u,10])
        // Expect array to display "Undefined" 


//Functional Tests:
        // A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

            // User logs in 
                // has access to more options since loged in 
                // checksout faster
                // - debit card saved on file 
                // - address on file 
                // able to send user a reminder if nothing is moved to cart 
            // User stays as guest 
                // gets reminded to sign up 
                // once shopping can not leave or selected items wont stay 
                // no access to deals
                //
